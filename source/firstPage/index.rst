Tutorial on working with a Kali Linux machine (Basics)

* Step 1- Have correct equipment
    * Computer
    * Personal Internet
    * Stable Connection
    * SD card/ Flash Drive

There are many versions of Kali Linux that you may use, but before we can think about
what to download, let us make sure you have the right equipment to start. An excellent
start to wanting to work in an IT field would be getting familiar with the hardware
that you will be using. It may be interesting to you to see how little is needed to
run Kali Linux.

The basic item every tech person will need is a computer. It does not matter what kind
of computer you are using. You can use a Windows, Mac, or even a Raspberry Pi.
For this example, I will be showing how to install Kali Linux on a Raspberry Pi,
but the process is similar to a Windows or Mac machine. Depending on what route you want
to take to install the operating system, you will need a USB port, CD drive, or a
SD slot for this installation walk-through. This is how we will download the OS to our system.

You will also need a stable internet connection to download Kali Linux onto a bootable
USB or DVD. I found it easier to use a USB because they are small and can hold a large
amount of data. Depending on what version/type of Kali Linux is needed, you will need
a flash drive to store that much data. A safe bet is to have a 32 GB flash drive, and
a 64 GB should be plenty big to download whatever version of Kali is needed.

For this walk through we will be installing Kali Linux from the `official website <https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/>`_
for ARM processors. Click on whichever image is applicable to you and your Raspberry Pi, I will
be using the 64-bit version. We then will need to write this image onto our SD card with
the Raspberry Pi Imager software. To do this, you will either need to have another computer or an extra SD card for
your Raspberry Pi.

Once Kali Linux is installed, you will also want to have your own internet or internet
that you have permission to work on without getting in trouble. This is to allow us
to practice hacking on your own equipment without facing repercussions that may arise.
The different tools that come with Kali Linux help protect and analyze a network, but they can be harmful
if used in the hands of someone trying to do evil. Some businesses will not like people experimenting with
Kali Linux on their internet, so be sure to use your own or get permission first.

* Step 2 Protecting Yourself
    * Illegal if no permission
    * VPN possibly
* Step 3- Download Kali Linux
    * Different types (SCREEN SHOTS)
        * Intel PCs
        * Virtual Machine
        * ARM (RASPBERRY PI) this is what I am using

Cyber-security specialists use Kali Linux to test and work on their network security.
This software offers more than 600 tools for these specialists to use. [#f2]_
