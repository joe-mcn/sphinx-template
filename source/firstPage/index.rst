Cyber-security specialists use Kali Linux to test and work on their network security.
This software offers more than 600 tools for these specialists to use. [#f2]_ There are
many versions of Kali Linux that you may use, but before we can think about
what to download, let us make sure you have the right equipment to start. An excellent
start to wanting to work in an IT field would be getting familiar with the hardware
that you will be using.

To begin, you are going to need a computer. It does not matter what kind of computer
you are using. You can use a Windows, Mac, a Raspberry Pi, or even a virtual machine.
For this example, I will be showing how to install Kali Linux on a Raspberry Pi,
but the process is similar to a Windows or Mac machine. You will obviously need
RAM, hard disk and a port for USB devices.

You will also need a stable internet connection to download Kali Linux onto a bootable
USB or DVD. I found it easier to use a USB because they are small and can hold a large
amount of data. Depending on what version/type of Kali Linux is needed, you will need
a flash drive to store that much data. A safe bet is to have a 32 GB flash drive, and
a 64 GB should be plenty big to download whatever version of Kali is needed.

Once Kali Linux is installed, you will also want to have your own internet or internet
that you have permission to work on without getting in trouble. The different tools
that come with Kali Linux help protect and analyze a network, but they can be harmful
if used in the wrong hands. Some businesses will not like people experimenting with
Kali Linux on their internet, so be sure to use your own or get permission first.
