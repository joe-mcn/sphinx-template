* Step 1- Have correct equipment
    * Computer
    * Personal Internet
    * Stable Connection
    * SD card/ Flash Drive

Kali Linux is used by cyber-security specialists to test and work on their network security.
There are many versions of Kali Linux that you may use, but before we can think about what to download,
lets make sure you have the right equipment to start out. A good start to wanting to
work in an IT field would be getting familiar with the hardware that you will be using.

To start out, you are going to need a computer. It does not matter what kind of computer you
are using. You can use a Windows, Mac, a Raspberry Pi, or even a virtual machine.
For this example, I will be showing how to install Kali Linux on a Raspberry Pi, but the
process is similar to a Windows or Mac machine.

You are also going to need a stable internet connection to download Kali Linux onto a
bootable USB or DVD. I found it easier to use a USB due to the fact they are small and are able
to hold a large amount of data. Depending on what version/type of Kali Linux needed,
you are going to need a flashdrive that is able to hold that much data. A safe bet
is to have a 32 GB flash drive, and a 64 GB should be plenty big to download whatever
version of Kali is needed.

Once Kali Linux is installed, you are also going to want to have
your personal internet or internet that you have permission to work on without getting
in trouble. The different tools that come with Kali Linux are useful for protecting and analyzing
a network, but if used in the wrong hands it can be harmful. Some places will not like
people experimenting with Kali Linux on their internet, so be sure to use your own
or get permission first.
