How To Practice Hacking and Why You Should
------------------------------------------
There is technology all around people in today’s world. Ranging from cell phones,
computers, and game consoles to vehicles, security systems, and home
utensils. A good majority of these people do not know how most of this new
technology works. This leads to most people becoming unaware of the possible
ways they can be exposed through this technology.

Benjamin Herald [#f1]_ writes about the concern of the shortage of cyber-security
workers in America. The one way to solve this problem is to introduce students
to cyber-security-related education during grade school. Less than one-fourth of
high-school seniors have taken computer science related course. This is
concerning when the world they live in now mainly consists of technology. This
article also mentions how quickly the field of cyber-security changes. Programming
languages come and go quickly, so the language a student learns in high school may
not be relevant when he applies for jobs in the future. [#f1]_

If a person feels as though they are not getting enough knowledge through their
schooling, or if they are wanting to get started within cyber-security, there is a
tremendous number of resources online. How To Practice Your Hacking Skills from
TechSolutions [#f2]_ explains in great detail explaining how to practice legal
hacking. This website also gives a quick rundown of common terms such as white hat
hacking. Ethical hacking consists of trying to exploit their organizations security,
which is what a true hacker would be doing. The only difference is that the
“White Hat Hacker’s” duty is to protect that information whereas the
“Black Hat Hacker” tries to expose the organizations with the data they collect.

This website also contains multiple domains that help teach some skills are
available to anyone that can access the internet. A good website that I have tried
is HackThisSite.org [#f3]_. This starts out easy and gets more difficult the further
you work on this website. It has you find a password for each level that is
somewhere hidden within the website. Here are the other domains listed in this website.

* ``bWAPP``
* ``Buggy Web Application``
* ``Google Gruyere``
* ``HackThis!!``
* ``Hack This Site``
* ``Game of Hacks``
* ``Vicnum``
* ``McAfee HacMe Sites``
* ``Try2Hack``
* ``OverTheWire``
* ``Mutillidae``
* ``Root Me``
* ``Peruggia``
* ``WebGoat``

A good book found from the Dunn Library, The Basics of Hacking and Penetration
Testing: Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing Made Easy [#f4]_ talks about the
different free tools that are available to anyone to help with hacking. A good
start to one learning hacking is to become knowledgeable with Linux. This
book will introduce you to the different software and walk you through how to
start a Kali or BackTrack, which are both Linux operated. This also goes into the
details of writing a pen test report for a client to give them full details of
what the hacker has figured out from the penetration test.

I also was able to watch a video from USENIX Enigma's Conference [#f5]_ that was
not revolved around learning how to work in cyber-security, but rather how a
cyber-security team can operate to improve their performance. The speaker compared
the Secret Service to the job a cyber-security worker has. There is always a chance
that someone will try to break into the White House, just like there is always a
chance a person will try to break into a company’s internal infrastructure. The
professionals are more concerned about the response time and what happens when
they do find an intruder. They also want to focus on restricting the possibility
of easily maneuvering through the server and gaining access to the entire server.
